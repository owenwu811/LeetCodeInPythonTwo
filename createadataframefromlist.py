#Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called student_data. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.

#The DataFrame should have two columns, student_id and age, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.

#The result format is in the following example.


#my own solution using python3:

import pandas as pd

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=['student_id', 'age'])
