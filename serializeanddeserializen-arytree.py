#Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

#Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

#For example, you may serialize the following 3-ary tree


#my own solution using python3:

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val: Optional[int] = None, children: Optional[List['Node']] = None):
        if children is None:
            children = []
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
"""

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root: 'Node') -> str:
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: str
        """
        return root
	
    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> 'Node':
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: Node
        """
        return data
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))
